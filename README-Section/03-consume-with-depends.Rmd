## Using Package Dependencies

```{r 03-build-objects}
# build objects
library(redcapAPI)
rcon <- redcapConnection(url = "https://not-a-valid-url.org",
                         token = "Not-a-Valid-Token")
fit <- lm(mpg ~ qsec, data = mtcars)
```

One way to get `consume` to work with methods from multiple packages is to include each package with a tidier you wish to use in the `Depends:` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file.  

```{r 03-demonstrate, error = TRUE}
library(broom.consumeUseDepends)
consume(fit)
consume(rcon)
```

While this approach works, it carries two major drawbacks

1. I must know which packages have tidiers that I wish to utilize.  The `consume` function cannot operate with any arbitrary tidier.
2. It could require loading multiple packages into the search path, which is considered bad practice.
