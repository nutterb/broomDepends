### Reliance on Explicit Imports

```{r 04-build-objects}
# build objects
library(redcapAPI)
rcon <- redcapConnection(url = "https://not-a-valid-url.org",
                         token = "Not-a-Valid-Token")
fit <- lm(mpg ~ qsec, data = mtcars)
```

This solution breaks down when packages are not included in the `Imports:`.  While the previous example had a package that imported both `broom` and `broom.extend`, the following example only imports `broom`.  Thus, `consume` will fail for the `rcon` object.

```{r 04-demonstrate, error = TRUE}
library(broom.consumeUseImportBroom)
consume(fit)
consume(rcon)
```
