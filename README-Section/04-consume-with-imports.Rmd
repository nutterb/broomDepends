## Using Package Imports

```{r 04-build-objects}
# build objects
library(redcapAPI)
rcon <- redcapConnection(url = "https://not-a-valid-url.org",
                         token = "Not-a-Valid-Token")
fit <- lm(mpg ~ qsec, data = mtcars)
```

The natural inclination to avoid the second drawback of using `Depends:` is to use `Imports` instead. Including `#' @import broom` and `#' @import broom.extend` allows this to work for the tidiers in both packages. However, it still requires explicitly naming packages for which `consume` will work.  That is, it is not an arbitrary solution.

```{r 04-demonstrate, error = TRUE}
library(broom.consumeUseImports)
consume(fit)
consume(rcon)
```
